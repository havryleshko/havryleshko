- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alex
- 👀 The branch I am particularly interested in is machine learning; I work in Python. Also, I like working with investments and finance in general. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, on my way to becoming a professional developer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve working with finance, AI models and machine learning in general. I am more than happy to contribute to any project as I need to learn as much as possible
